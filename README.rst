 org-dedup -- Deduplicates an org-mode file
============================================

Sometimes when I using the Emacs org-mode in a git repository checked
out on multiple machines, I get merge conflicts. Sometimes, I
accidentally mismerge them, and end up having the same text in two
locations in the file.

``org-dedup`` is a quick tool to deduplicate the contents of a single
org-mode file.
